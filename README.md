# Fibonacci-Sequence-Pattern-Generation-Using-CPP
In this cpp program, we will print the Fibonacci sequence having terms in a specific interval. Also, we will divide each term by an integer number and print their remainders. By plotting the remainder on a circle we can see mesmerizing patterns. Simply by changing the integer number, different patterns can be obtained for every different integer number. However, we have to put all possible remainders for that specific integer.Go through the readme file for a detailed explanation. Also, for generated pattern, check Generated Pattern.
