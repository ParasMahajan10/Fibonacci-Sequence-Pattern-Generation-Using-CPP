Fibonacci-Sequence-Pattern-Generation-Using-CPP
Fibonacci sequence is majorly known for its geometrical patterns. In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... are the terms of fibonacci sequence.
One of the most well known pattern formed by fibonacci sequence is the fabionacci spiral in which an arrangement of squares having dimentions equal to each term of the fibonicci sequence is made and by joining peritcular points a spiral is formed which looks mesmarizing. Moreover, there are lots of patters that can be formed by using fibonacci sequence either by directly using the terms of sequence - fabionacci spiral - or manuplaiting the terms of sequence. For example if we divide each term by any integer number and every time if calculate the remainder from each term and plot those remainders on circle, by sequentially joining those remainders, we can get different patterns for each integer number.
This cpp program is intended for printing fibonacci sequence and divide each term by a specific integer number that we can change according to our need and to calculate remainder each time for each term.
Following steps we can follow in order to make pattern from fibonacci sequence.
step 1 : Run the cpp program. Here we can change dividing integer number (5 in this case) to any number but since 5 gives us a star pattern, we are using 5.
step 2 : The output of the program will show every term of fibonacci sequence fro specified interval as well as remainders for each term of the sequence.
step 3 : Take a note of all the remainders sequentially.
step 4 : Now grab a paper and draw a circle on it. Take a random point on it and start wirting all the numbers from 0 to 4. Since we are dividing by 5, the range of the remainders will be 0 up to 4 only.
step 5 : Now sequentially join all the remainders from the remainder sequence. Trace a line from each consequtative remainder and after finishing that you will see a star formed by tracing all remainders.
step 6 : We can change the dividing integer number to get different pattern. Simply change integer in the program and repeat all the steps above, you can see a different pattern for every integer.
